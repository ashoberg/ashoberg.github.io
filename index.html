			<ul>
			<li>"That's 2 hours of my life that I'll never EVER get back."</li>
			<li>"It was...ai'ight."</li>
			<li>Said while vaguely waving a hand back and forth: "Eh."</li>
			<li>"A horror movie I'd fall asleep to again and again."</li>
			<li>"It was amazing in that, it pretty much included every <em>single</em> horror movie cliche you can imagine, all packed into one film. And it wasn't even a parody; no <em>Scream</em> tongue-in-cheek kitsch or sarcasm, just cliches. Cliches everywhere."</li>
			<li>"I watched the trailer and I had no clue what it was supposed to be about. I just walked out of the movie...and I <em>still</em> don't know."</li>
			<li>"I never thought I'd say this, but <em>Don't Look in the Basement</em> was actually better than this burning trash heap."</li>
			</ul>
